  <p><b>Intro to Programming (March 9th, 2015)</b></p>

<b>What you'll Learn to Do:</b>

- Build a web page and put it online<br>
- Automate email<br>
- Piece together a program

<p><b>Thinking like a Programmer</b></p>

- Procedural Thinking: Step by step<br>
- Abstract Thinking: Finding similarity (1 + 1 = 2)<br>
- Systems Thinking: Big picture thinking, creating a plan<br>
- Technological Empathy: Understanding a computer (what is, does good/bad, how it works)<br>
- Debugging: Systematic process is identifying issue (bug) in code.

<p><b>The Basics of the Web (Unit 1, March 11th, 2015)</b></p>

A) Browser - A program that displays files found on the web (Program)<br>
B) Internet - Largest network in the WORLD!!<br>
C) HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol<br>
D) Servers - Computers dedicated to hosting the files browsed by your browser

<p><b>HTML</b></p>

Hypertext Markup Language. These form the majority of documents on the web.<br>
These documents contain markups (tags, etc), references (images), text content, and hyperlinks.

<p><b>Tags/Elements</b></p>

Tags include things such as <.b>, <.em>, <.p>, <.br> and many more.<br>
(Period used to keep them from activating, is there a way to do this differently?)<br>
Tags can also be within each other.

<p>Elements are the entire structure, such as using the opening and closing tag sandwiching the contents.</p>

<p><b>HTML Attributes</b></p>

An attribute example learned in this lesson was "href", with the tag "a" to allow for hyperlinking!<br>
Example of hyperlinking: <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity!</a><hr>
Example of embedding an image: <img src="http://whatscookingamerica.net/Vegetables/Russet_Potato.jpg" alt="A potato">
<br>The above is an example of a void tag. It does not need a tag with / in it to complete it.

<p><b>Whitespace</b></p>

<p>This is the use of a tag that is used to break up a line<br> to the next one on a webpage, since you can
break a line within HTML and without the tag, it won't show as a broken line.</p>

The <.p> tag can be used the same way as the <.br> tag can be used, except that it breaks twice, so it can be used<br>
to double space essentially.

<p><b>Inline/Block</b></p>

I am fuzzy on this concept. From my understanding tags such as <.br>, <.a>, or <.span> (which I don't understand)<br>
are all inline, meaning they don't form a block and stay in line such as:<br>

<p><span>This is span, see how it doesn't break up?</span>
   <div>But this one did </div>break up?
</p>

This requires more practice, I'm not comfortable with it yet.
